            <p>
              These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Site or in respect to the
              Site constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or
              enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not operate as a waiver of such right or
              provision. These Terms of Service operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or
              all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any
              loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision
              or part of a provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
              provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Service and does not affect the
              validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership,
              employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Terms of Service or use
              of the Site. You agree that these Terms of Service will not be construed against us by virtue of having
              drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these
              Terms of Service and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms of Service.

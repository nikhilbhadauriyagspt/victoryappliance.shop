    title: "Washing Machine Not Draining? Here’s What to Do",
    excerpt: "Finding your washing machine full of dirty water is frustrating. Learn the step-by-step process to diagnose and fix drainage issues.",
    content: `
      <p>Few things are more frustrating than opening your washing machine and finding clothes sitting in dirty water. If your washing machine is not draining properly, several issues could be responsible.</p>
      <p>Here’s a step-by-step guide to understanding and fixing the problem.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 1: Check for a Clogged Drain Hose</h3>
      <p>The drain hose carries wastewater out of the machine. If clogged or kinked, water won’t exit properly.</p>
      <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Turn off the machine</li>
        <li>Inspect hose for bends</li>
        <li>Remove debris if visible</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Clean the Drain Pump Filter</h3>
      <p>Lint, coins, and small objects often block the pump filter.</p>
      <p><strong>How to clean:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Locate filter panel</li>
        <li>Place towel under machine</li>
        <li>Remove and clean filter</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Regular cleaning prevents drainage problems.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 3: Inspect the Drain Pump</h3>
      <p>If the pump motor fails, water won’t drain.</p>
      <p><strong>Signs of pump failure:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Humming sound without draining</li>
        <li>Burning smell</li>
        <li>Error codes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Pump replacement requires professional service.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 4: Check Lid Switch or Door Lock</h3>
      <p>Front-load machines won’t drain if the door lock is faulty. If the machine doesn’t detect a secure door, it stops the cycle.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 5: Control Board Issues</h3>
      <p>Modern washing machines rely on electronic control boards. A malfunction may interrupt the drain cycle. Professional diagnosis is recommended for electrical issues.</p>
      
      <h3>Prevent Future Drain Problems</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Avoid overloading</li>
        <li>Use proper detergent</li>
        <li>Clean filter monthly</li>
        <li>Check pockets before washing</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>When to Call a Professional</h3>
      <p>Call a technician if water remains after cleaning filter, the pump makes unusual noise, machine displays error codes, or DIY troubleshooting fails. Prompt repair prevents water damage and mold growth.</p>
      
      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>Drainage problems are common but manageable when addressed early. Routine maintenance and timely repair keep your washing machine running efficiently.</p>
